            <ul>
                <li> <small>To divert interest from the poet to the poetry is a laudable aim: for it would conduce to a juster estimation of actual poetry</small></li>
                <li><small>The emotion of art is impersonal</small></li>
                <li><small>An open call for the banishment of the poet, or at least the poet’s emotion, from the center of criticism.</small></li>
                <li><small>Separate emotion from the poet and redefine it.</small></li>
                <li><small>Locates the meaning and value of a literary work in its dynamic relationship with European literary and intellectual traditions as a whole.</small></li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left"> I. A. Richards and William Empson</p>
             <ul>
                <li> <small>Look for the meaning and value of a literary work exclusively in the text itself and develop new techniques of close reading.</small></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p align="left"> After the departure of the poet as the purported conveyor of truth, is there still truth in literature?</p>
            
             <ul>
                <li> <small>The first generation of American New Critics (Allen Tate and John Crowe Ransom)</small></li>
            </ul>
            
            <ol>
                <li> <small>Enshrine poetry as ontic truth that can, in Arnold’s words, “console us” and “sustain us” against the onslaught of science and industrialization</small></li>
                
                <li> <small>Avail of analytical close reading to locate the ontic truth of poetry</small></li>
                
                <li> <small>Ransom:<br/> It is only in concrete poetic images (as opposed to abstract ideas of science and philosophy) that a critic can find the truth of life or “the object which is real, individual and qualitatively infinite.”<br/>The primary aim of formal study, Ransom maintains, is not to find the meaning and value of a text in question but to discover the truth for human life in general.</small></li>
            </ol>
            
            <ul>
                <li> <small>The second generation of American New Critics(Brooks, Purser, and Warren)</small></li>
            </ul>
            
             <ol>
                <li> <small>The “truth”of literature takes the form, not of abstract statement, but of a concrete and dramatic presentation</small></li>
                
                <li> <small>Focus on examining the unifying principle of form in a literary text.</small></li>
