            <ul>
                <li> <small>Relate the reading process to an engagement with phenomenological truth or the pure Cogito.</small></li>
                <li><small>Direct serious critical attention to the reading process</small></li>
                <li><small>The ultimate reality, the pure Cogito, emerges through a realization of the intentionality of objects in a mental state untainted by rational concepts and categories.</small></li>
                <li><small>The reading of a literary text approximates such a phenomenological process because it effectively dissolves the barrier between subject and object. </small></li>
                <li><small>In the course of reading, the object of print, the authorial consciousness, and the reading subject merge into a new, transpersonal consciousness.</small></li>
                 <li><small>Dynamics and consequence of reading(Roman Ingarden):</small></li>

                <li> <small>Pre-aesthetic analysis and the aesthetic concretization of literature</small></li>
                
                <li> <small>Every literary work is a stratified structure composed of four interrelated strata: sound-formations, meaningunits, schematized aspects, and presented world.</small></li>

             <ul>
                <li> <small>Ingarden's gestalt is different from the New Critical as well as the structuralist models of literary structure that were developed later.</small></li>
            </ul>
            
            <ol>
                <li> <small>It didn't entail operation of an overarching rhetorical principle such as paradox or irony, nor the proliferation of structuralist binarisms predicated on the langue /parole dichotomy. </small></li>
                
                <li> <small>Rather, it involves successive intentional acts of consciousness,or a process of phenomenological reduction, leading to the cognition of what Ingarden calls simple qualities or essences (sound configuration, sentence-correlate, ready-aspect) and derived essences (metaphysical quality) that emerges from the interface of these simple essences.</small></li>
                
            </ol>
        <ul>
            <li> <small>Ingarden attaches great importance to the reader’s role</small></li>

                <li> <small>Devotes himself to a study of aesthetic concretization as intentional acts of consciousness. </small></li>
                
                <li> <small>Redefines reading as an experience identical to the phenomenological process described by Merleau-Ponty.</small></li>
                
                <li> <small>Experience a new consciousness emerging in the virtual space of our own thought, the objects of print, and the authorial consciousness.</small></li>
                
                <li> <small>This new consciousness transcends the separation between subject and object, between the fictional and the actual, it approximates to the pure Cogito or the ultimate truth</small></li>
                
                <li> <small>Truth co-arises and is inseparably bound up with our perceptual experience exemplified by the reading of literature.</small></li>
