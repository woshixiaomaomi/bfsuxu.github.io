             <p align="left"> Deconstruction of truth-claims the sole purpose of its own existence </p>
            
            
             <p align="left"> Derrida derives his tenets of deconstruction from Saussurean linguistics </p>
            
            <p align="left"> For Derrida, the Saussurean idea of the insubstantial, arbitrary nature of linguistic signs lays the theoretic ground for deconstructing all claims of truth in and through language. </p>
            
            <p align="left"> Deconstructive criticism precludes any possibility of a self-present truth in language </p>
            
            <p align="left"> All these truth-claims are in and of themselves arbitrary linguistic signs, they are subjected to the rules of différance—a coinage by Derrida to denote the unavoidable gap between a signifier and its signified(s) in terms of spatial distance and temporal deferment. Owing to this gap, any truth-claim inevitably falls short of being a transcendental selfpresence. The existence and do. </p>
            
            <p align="left"> Derrida: </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> <small>Western metaphysics is grounded on the false assumption of the self-presence of the phoné or the logos.</small></li>
                <li><small>By analyzing infinite play of signifiers inside truth claims of différance, he shows that the transcendental selfpresence invested in all those terms is nothing but illusion.</small></li>
                <li><small>The play of différance inside the privileged term of a given binary opposition and hence invalidate any attempt to reify the term as a self-presence aligned with the logos.</small></li>
               
            </ul>
            
            <p align="left"> Paul de Man:</p>  
            <ul>
            <li><small>Deconstructive textual analysis: The play of di¤érance serves the practical purposes of invalidating the presumptions of fixed, self-present meanings in literature and breaking any closure in human thought and action at large.</small></li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left">Later use:</p> 
            <ul>
            <li><small>Later deconstructive critics take up deconstructive textual analysis as a useful method for their psychoanalytical, Marxist, feminist, and other post-structuralist analyses of literary texts.</small></li>
            <li><small>Use this method to open up literary language, in order to see its inherent connections with strategies of power for perpetuating the hierarchies of sexual, ethnic, racial, and class relationships.</small></li>
            <li><small>Challenge authority, to shake up institutions, and to overturn certain social values, norms, and hierarchies.</small></li>
            <li><small>They follow the same dualistic mode of thinking as do their truth-claiming and truth-disclaiming predecessors, because they too often set up, consciously or not, a new hierarchical binary opposition in which one set of values, norms, and principles is valorized explicitly or implicitly as truth over the other.</small></li>
